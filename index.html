<h2>How to request return of funds</h2>
<p>I'm working on a streamlined anonymous process based on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/298j2m/bip1337_a_protocol_to_request_return_of_lost_coins/">feedback collected</a> from my earlier <a href="https://github.com/btcrobinhood/bips/blob/master/bip-1337.mediawiki">BIP 1337</a> proposal.  Once that is done it will be posted here.  In the mean time <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/btcrobinhood/">PM me on reddit</a>.</p>
    
<p>If you PM me you should <strong>cite specific transaction ids</strong> and be prepared to present signatory evidence demonstrating control of <a href="https://github.com/btcrobinhood/bips/blob/master/bip-1337.mediawiki#Standard_Evidence_Threshold">related addresses</a>.  In the case of passphrase-based brainwallets, mere knowledge of a passphrase does not prove you were the person who originally funded it since by now armies of scoundrels have uncovered these phrases.</p>

<p><strong>Under no circumstances will I send you someone else's coins</strong> so don't bother asking.</p>

<h2>What has and has not been snatched</h2>

<p>My shenanigans have always been restricted in scope to deducing bitcoin private keys via methods relying on publicly available information only.  In other words, I've only found keys so hopelessly bad that they can be guessed by anyone just by looking at them.  <strong>If you are a victim of malware, phishing, intrusion or an otherwise "active attack" it was not me and I can not help you.</strong></p>

<p>Just because you had a brainwallet (or otherwise weak key) snatched does not mean it was my bot.  My bot entered the game after others were already playing, did not kept pace with competitors in either scope or latency and at no point was batting 1000.  <strong>My bot became uncompetitive to the point that I have retired it.</strong>  My <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/295las/35_of_my_btc_gone_pc_not_compromised">June 2014 RNG find</a> was due to a one-off search I performed after that issue had already been <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/266hdb/psa_brainwalletorgs_random_button_uses_lowentropy/chovb50">reported and exploited</a> by someone else.  It was based on a correct hunch that the original exploiter had performed too narrow a search of that space of weak keys.</p>

<h2>Words of wisdom</h2>
<p><strong>Avoid brainwallets.</strong></p>
<p>Using poorly written wallet software can compromise your bitcoin.</p>
<p>Don't drink beer before liquor.</p>
